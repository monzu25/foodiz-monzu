                <h2>Artichoke Pizza </h2>
                <p>See, I wanted to save this pizza (here I go saving recipes again) for next week. It’s perfect for
                    Monday night football and I thought posting it next week would be a little better idea, seeing as
                    football starts on the eighth… but then this whole thing involving some chocolate, an obscene amount
                    of eggs and a little powdered sugar happened and it consumed my life for the last three days.
                    Meaning I didn’t get to make the recipe I wanted to for today. That recipe was a tad more summery
                    than this pizza, but… oh well, you can never really go wrong with a great pizza.</p>

                <h2>Pasta Aglio e Olio</h2>
                <p>Following a recipe can be a nerve-racking task, especially when it's hyper-involved. For example, one
                    step can include three different instructions, kind of like this: Add one teaspoon of paprika and
                    two teaspoons of thyme into the pan with minced garlic and onion, swirl, and reduce heat to prevent
                    burning. And hey, sometimes you're just trying to make something quick, like an easy pasta dish, so
                    there's no need for it to be that complicated, right? OK, you get the idea. Cooking can be
                    stressful, especially for the person who isn't used to experimenting with new recipes and is just
                    looking for something easy to cook. At the same time, if you've exhausted all of your go-to dishes,
                    you may be due for a new recipe.</p>

                <h2>Steamed Rice</h2>
                <p>It's time for dinner, and you're starving. Even though ordering some Chinese takeout may sound like
                    the easiest move, having to wait 45 minutes before eating doesn't exactly sound like the quickest
                    option. So why not satisfy your craving with this easy vegetarian rice bowl instead? Not only is
                    this recipe easy to make, but it will only take 10 minutes to throw it together. Yes,really, 10
                    minutes! It's amazing what a package of instant rice can do. Using only a few key ingredients,
                    you'll have your own at-home version of Chinese food without having to wait.</p>
